"""BinaryLLMJudge — atomic YES/NO LLM calls with reasoning capture.

Core principle: LLM only classifies, never scores. Each call asks
exactly one binary question and returns one verdict plus a 1-2
sentence rationale. Programs aggregate the binary results into
scores. This enforces deterministic aggregation — the same
classification always produces the same aggregate, with zero LLM
algebraic drift.

The rationale capture (``judge_with_reasoning``) is what makes the
per-case evaluation trace actually diagnose-able — it's the
Meta-Harness paper §3 "model outputs" trace component for any
semantic assertion. Without it, a failing path_hit or fact_coverage
check just tells the proposer "the LLM said no", not *why*.

This module depends only on:
  - ``llm._call_llm`` (lazy-imported to avoid a module-import cycle
    with ``evaluators`` → ``llm`` → ``evaluators``)
  - stdlib (os, subprocess, sys, time)

It has NO runtime dependency on ``evaluators.py``; extracting it
into its own file removes ~190 lines from evaluators.py without any
functional change. ``evaluators.py`` re-exports ``BinaryLLMJudge``
for back-compat so every existing ``from evaluators import
BinaryLLMJudge`` keeps working.
