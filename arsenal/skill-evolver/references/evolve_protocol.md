# Evolve Core Protocol (8 Phases)

This document defines the complete execution protocol for Evolve mode. Each iteration strictly follows Phases 0 through 8.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-flight Checks

Before starting any iteration, verify:

1. **Skill directory integrity**: SKILL.md exists, directory structure is valid
2. **Ground truth ready**: Assertions exist with dev/holdout split
3. **Clean git state**: `git status` shows no uncommitted changes
4. **Workspace ready**: Reuse Creator's `<skill-name>-workspace/`, confirm `evolve/` subdirectory exists
   - Can invoke `python3 scripts/setup_workspace.py <skill-path>`
5. **Generate evolve_plan.md**: Analyze skill and GT data, produce an adaptive optimization plan (see `references/eval_strategy.md`)
6. **Determine current mutation layer**:
   - Starting layer is determined by the optimization priorities in `evolve_plan.md`
   - K consecutive iterations (K specified in plan, default 5) with no improvement at the current layer triggers promotion
7. **Establish baseline** (first iteration only):
   - Run one evaluation round per the evolve_plan.md strategy
   - Record baseline in `<workspace>/evolve/results.tsv` (iteration 0)
   - Snapshot the current skill to `<workspace>/evolve/best_versions/`

---

## Phase 1: Review (Read Memory, Complete Within 30 Seconds)

At the start of each iteration, read:

```bash
# 1. Recent experiment history
git log --oneline -20

# 2. Results log
tail -20 <workspace>/evolve/results.tsv

# 3. Fine-grained memory (if exists)
tail -10 <workspace>/evolve/experiments.jsonl

# 4. Most recent iteration's metadata + per-case traces (paper §2 grep/cat model)
cat <workspace>/evolve/iteration-E{N-1}/meta.json
grep -l '"pass": false' <workspace>/evolve/iteration-E*/cases/*.json
```

**Extract from memory:**
- Which mutation types succeeded (status=keep) -- exploit these
- Which mutation types failed (status=discard) -- avoid repeating
- Which cases consistently fail -- prioritize these
- Which cases are fragile (easily regressed) -- use as regression guards
- Whether stuck (5+ consecutive discards) -- switch to radical strategy

**Read per-case JSON files selectively from `evolve/iteration-E{N-1}/cases/` for failing cases. `phase_1_review` returns `failed_case_paths` — a list of the specific case JSON files with at least one failed assertion. Use the `Read` tool to open each one; use `Grep` for cross-iteration patterns. Do NOT try to ingest all cases — Phase 1 returns pointers, not content, per the Meta-Harness paper §2 access model ("the proposer retrieves via standard operations such as grep and cat rather than ingesting them as a single prompt"). Diagnose WHY failures happened, not just THAT they happened.**

---

## Phase 2: Ideate (Decide What to Change)

**⚠️ Execution model changed (Module B, isolation)**: Phase 2 and Phase 3 used to run in the SAME continuous context — whether that was one `claude -p` call (CLI mode) or the driving Claude reasoning through both phases itself in one unbroken trace (in-conversation mode, which SKILL.md calls the primary path: "Claude IS the LLM, there is zero claude -p shell-out"). That meant the diagnoser and the mutator were never actually isolated from each other, just two labels for the same reasoning trace. They now run as two genuinely separate steps:

- **CLI mode**: call `llm.phase_2_diagnose(...)` then (in a separate step) `llm.phase_3_modify(...)` — two independent `claude -p` subprocess calls, no shared memory.
- **In-conversation mode**: use `isolation.build_diagnoser_task_spec(skill_path, workspace, review, gt_path, current_layer)` to get an Agent tool call spec, issue that Agent tool call yourself, then parse the result with `isolation.parse_diagnosis_response(...)`. Do NOT do the diagnosis reasoning yourself in this same context — the isolation only holds if a genuinely separate Agent tool call does it.

`build_diagnoser_task_spec` physically excludes holdout content (filters any holdout-tagged path out of `review` before building the prompt — see `isolation.py`), so the diagnoser below only ever gets dev-split evidence, regardless of what Phase 1 happened to load.

Based on Phase 1 analysis (passed into `review`), the diagnoser selects a mutation direction by priority:

**Priority ranking:**

1. **Fix crashes**: Cases that crashed last iteration -- fix first
2. **Exploit successful patterns**: Mutation types that were kept last iteration -- try similar variants
3. **Attack persistent failures**: Cases that fail across multiple iterations -- targeted improvement
4. **Explore new directions**: Cross-reference results + git log -- find untried approaches
5. **Simplify**: Remove ineffective parts of the skill while maintaining metrics
6. **Radical**: When stuck (5+ consecutive discards), attempt bold changes

**MANDATORY: Before proposing any change, cite specific trace evidence. State a counterfactual diagnosis: "Case X failed because of Y. If we change Z, the output would instead do W."**

**Output** (the diagnosis dict — see `isolation.parse_diagnosis_response`):
- `failure_patterns`: which cases/assertions failed and why (trace evidence, not a guess)
- `recommended_focus`: one-sentence description of the intended change, handed to Phase 3
- `layer_suggestion`: which layer to act in
- `evidence_refs`: what evidence the diagnosis is based on

**Anti-patterns (forbidden — written in the imperative "do not X" form so they are greppable and unambiguous):**
- do not repeat a change that was already discarded with identical content (check git log first)
- do not bundle multiple unrelated changes in one iteration (the one-sentence test: if you need "and" to describe it, it is two changes)
- do not make cross-layer changes
- do not guess — if no trace evidence points to a clear cause, say so explicitly and gather more evidence first (Meta-Trace mandatory protocol)
- **do not identify a problem without fixing it** -- if it is a problem, it warrants an iteration

---

## Phase 3: Modify (One Atomic Change)

Execute the change based on Phase 2's diagnosis — as a SEPARATE step, not a continuation of the same reasoning trace that produced the diagnosis.

- **CLI mode**: `llm.phase_3_modify(skill_path, diagnosis, current_layer, model=...)`.
- **In-conversation mode**: `isolation.build_mutator_task_spec(skill_path, diagnosis, current_layer)`, issue the Agent tool call yourself, parse with `isolation.parse_mutation_response(...)`.

`build_mutator_prompt`'s function signature has no `review`/`gt_path`/`workspace` parameter — only `diagnosis` (Phase 2's structured output). There is no code path by which this step can see the raw case evidence, holdout content, or the diagnoser's own reasoning trace, only the diagnosis conclusions. Do not work around this by pasting Phase 2's raw evidence into the Phase 3 Agent call's prompt yourself — that defeats the isolation the whole point of this split is to provide.

**Rules:**
- Only modify files in the current layer
- The change must be explainable in one sentence
- Do NOT re-derive your own diagnosis — act on the one Phase 2 produced
- Post-modification self-check: run `references/mutation_policy.md`'s "Atomic Change Self-Check" (one-sentence test + file count + diff size) — don't restate its thresholds here, they'd drift out of sync

**Modification principles:**
- Prefer explaining "why" over hard-coding MUST/NEVER
- Prefer structural/flow changes over adding more text
- If multiple cases independently duplicate the same helper logic, extract it into a script

---

## Phase 4: Commit

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "experiment(<layer>): <one-sentence description>"
```

Examples:
```
experiment(body): add path-merging rules for cross-category retrieval
experiment(body): simplify node selection prompt in Stage 2
experiment(description): expand trigger coverage for edge-case scenarios
```

**Git-first strategy (four-step decision tree):**

Check in order; use git whenever possible, degrade only as a last resort:

**Step 1: Check whether the directory is under git control**
```bash
git -C <skill-path> rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null
```
- [OK] Already under git control -- proceed directly to Phase 1

**Step 2: Git installed but not initialized -- initialize immediately**
```bash
git --version 2>/dev/null  # check if git is installed
```
- [OK] Git is installed, just not initialized -- **run git init, do not skip, do not degrade**:
```bash
cd <skill-path>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: init git for evolve tracking"
```

**Step 3: Git not installed -- refuse with install instructions (terminal)**

Git is a **hard requirement** for the evolve loop. `phase_4_commit`
commits experiments, `git_revert_last` rolls back discarded iterations,
and `phase_1_review` reads the git log for Phase 2 diagnosis context.
Every keep/discard decision is grounded in git state. There is no
folder-based fallback — the loop cannot run without git.

When `phase_0_setup` detects that the `git` binary is missing (the
``git status`` subprocess raises ``FileNotFoundError``), it raises
``RuntimeError`` with the actionable per-platform install instructions
below:

```
Phase 0: git is not installed. Install git and retry:
  macOS:  brew install git  or  xcode-select --install
  Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install git
  CentOS: sudo yum install git
  Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
```

Installing git on any modern platform takes under a minute. After
install, re-run evolve and Step 1 or Step 2 will take over.



## Phase 5: Verify (Execute Per evolve_plan.md Evaluation Strategy)

The evaluation strategy is not hard-coded; it is defined in `<workspace>/evolve/evolve_plan.md`. Three configurable evaluation tiers:

### Quick Gate (every iteration, seconds)

Can invoke `python3 scripts/run_l1_gate.py <skill-path> [--gt <gt-json>]`:
- Skill file syntax is valid (YAML frontmatter is legal)
- No obvious destructive changes
- Trigger quick-sample (sample size specified by evolve_plan)
- Hard assertion spot-check (sampled core GT cases)

**Quick Gate failure -- skip directly to Phase 6 discard; do not run Dev Eval.**

### Dev Eval (frequency defined by evolve_plan, minutes)

Orchestrated by Claude (spawn subagent + grader scoring), with `scripts/run_l2_eval.py` providing helper functions:

1. **Execute**: Spawn subagent, load skill, run each prompt
2. **Grade**: Read `agents/grader_agent.md` (or Creator's full version), judge each assertion
3. **Collect timing**: Record tokens and duration
4. **Aggregate**: `run_l2_eval.aggregate_grades()` -- produces stats dict consumed by `evolve_loop.write_meta_json` (which writes iteration-E{N}/meta.json); per-case details go to iteration-E{N}/cases/case_{id}.json via `evolve_loop.persist_cases`
5. **Focus areas**: High-priority assertion types marked in evolve_plan.md

### Strict Eval (trigger conditions defined by evolve_plan, ~10 minutes)

Trigger conditions (configured in evolve_plan.md):
- Auto-trigger every N iterations
- Or when Dev Eval pass_rate exceeds a threshold
- Or before a layer promotion

Content:
- Run holdout set (split="holdout")
- Run regression set (split="regression")
- Optional: blind A/B comparison (read `agents/comparator_agent.md`)

---

## Phase 6: Gate (Multi-Gate Decision)

Read `references/gate_rules.md` for complete gate logic.

**Simplified decision:**

```
IF crash or timeout → REVERT
IF L1 fail → DISCARD
IF dev_pass_rate > baseline.dev_pass_rate + min_delta
   AND trigger not degraded
   AND tokens <= baseline × 1.2
   AND duration <= baseline × 1.2
   AND regression not broken
   → KEEP
ELSE → DISCARD
```

**Keep action:**
- Update baseline to the current version
- Snapshot skill to best_versions/

**Discard action:**
```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```
Note: Use `git revert`, not `git reset`, to preserve the history of failed experiments.

**Revert action (crash / severe regression):**
```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```
Record crash reason in experiments.jsonl.

---

## Phase 6.5: Adversarial Review Panel

**⚠️ Module D — only runs when Phase 6 decided `keep`.** Reviewing a candidate that already failed the numeric gate would be wasted cost — this step exists to catch what the numeric gate cannot see (overfitting to dev, gaming a specific assertion's literal match, breaking a structural invariant), not to re-run the numeric check. Read `references/gate_rules.md`'s "Adversarial Review Panel" section for the full aggregation rule.

- **CLI mode**: `llm.phase_6_5_review(skill_path, diff, metrics, model=...)` — three independent `_call_claude` subprocess calls, one per checker, aggregated internally by `verifier_panel.aggregate_verdicts`.
- **In-conversation mode**: for each checker in `verifier_panel.CHECKERS` (`overfit`, `assertion_gaming`, `structural`) — call `verifier_panel.build_verifier_task_spec(skill_path, diff, metrics, checker)`, issue that Agent tool call yourself, parse the sub-agent's returned text with `verifier_panel.parse_verifier_response(response_text, checker)`. Do NOT do all three checks yourself in the same context — the isolation only holds if three genuinely separate Agent tool calls do it. After collecting all three verdicts, call `verifier_panel.aggregate_verdicts(verdicts)`.

`build_verifier_task_spec`'s signature has no `diagnosis`/`description` parameter — the verifiers never see the proposer's own account of what it did or why, only the diff Phase 4 committed and the metrics Phase 6 already computed. Do not work around this by pasting the proposer's description into a verifier's Agent call yourself — that defeats the isolation the whole point of this step is to provide.

**Decision handling:**
- `aggregate_verdicts` returns `"reject"` → override the Phase 6 decision to `discard`; proceed to the normal discard/revert path below.
- Returns `"skipped"` (>= 2 of the 3 verifier calls failed) → keep the Phase 6 decision as-is; record the skip explicitly (`adversarial_review: {"decision": "skipped", ...}`) — never silently treat a skip as a pass.
- Returns `"pass"` → the Phase 6 `keep` decision stands.

Log the full `aggregate_verdicts` return dict (all 3 verdicts + reasoning, not just the final decision) into the `experiment` record Phase 7 writes to experiments.jsonl — a dispute discovered later needs the full lineage to diagnose, not just "rejected".

---

## Phase 7: Log

### results.tsv

```bash
echo -e "${iteration}\t${commit}\t${metric}\t${delta}\t${trigger_f1}\t${tokens}\t${guard}\t${status}\t${layer}\t${description}" >> <workspace>/evolve/results.tsv
```

### experiments.jsonl

```bash
echo '{"iteration":N,"mutation_type":"...","mutation_layer":"...","intent":"...","diagnosis":"...","cases_improved":[...],"cases_degraded":[...],"trigger_delta":0.0,"token_delta":0,"status":"keep/discard","adversarial_review":{"decision":"pass","verdicts":[...],"reasoning":"..."}}' >> <workspace>/evolve/experiments.jsonl
```

### Progress Summary (every 10 iterations)

```
=== Skill Evolve Progress (iteration 20) ===
Baseline: 65.0% → Current best: 78.0% (+13.0%)
Keeps: 6 | Discards: 12 | Crashes: 2
Current layer: body
Last 5: keep, discard, discard, keep, keep
```

---

## Phase 8: Loop

- **bounded**: Reached max_iterations -- output summary + best skill
- **unbounded**: Continue to Phase 1
- **layer promotion**: Current layer has K consecutive iterations with no keep -- promote to next layer
- **stuck detection**: 5 consecutive discards -- switch to radical strategy (Priority 6)
- **exhaustion**: All 3 layers attempted with no improvement -- output final report and terminate

---

## Terminal Output

When Evolve terminates, output:

1. **best_skill/**: Complete skill directory of the current best version
2. **results.tsv**: Full experiment log
3. **experiments.jsonl**: Fine-grained memory
4. **summary.md**:
   - Improvement from baseline to best
   - List of effective changes
   - List of ineffective changes
   - Keep/discard ratio per layer
   - Recommended next optimization directions

---

## Artifact Cleanup

Evolve produces many intermediate artifacts (git commits, best_versions snapshots, evaluation outputs). Clean up after termination:

### Automatic Cleanup Rules

1. **best_versions/**: Retain only the 3 most recent snapshots; delete older ones
2. **iteration-EN/ evaluation artifacts**: Retain only the 5 most recent iterations and all kept iterations; delete the rest
3. **git history**: **Never auto-clean** (git revert preserves full history; manual squash is optional)

### Manual Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Clean evaluation artifacts (keep last 5 iterations + all kept iterations)
python3 scripts/evolve_loop.py <skill-path> --cleanup

# Clean best_versions (keep only the 3 most recent)
python3 scripts/evolve_loop.py <skill-path> --cleanup-versions

# Full cleanup (delete entire evolve/ subdirectory, preserve Creator data)
rm -rf <workspace>/evolve/
```

### Git Cleanup Recommendations

After Evolve completes, to clean experiment and revert commits from git history:
```bash
# Find the commit before evolve started
git log --oneline | grep -v "experiment\|Revert" | head -1

# Interactive rebase to that point (optional, not required)
# git rebase -i <commit-before-evolve>
```

**Note: Do not clean git during an active evolve run. Intermediate artifacts are part of the memory system.**
